(This is version 2.0 of Project 5. I am modifying the site so it can be deployed live.)

Orinco E-Commerce Site
===========================

The goal of the project is to use an API to retrieve and send data to an existing backend.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Site Structure:
---------------

* A list view page, showing all items available for sale. 
* A single product page (using URL query parameters), which will dynamically show the item selected by the user, display a description and price in dollars, and allow users to personalize the product and add it to their cart. 
* A cart page (using the localStorage JavaScript functionality), showing a summary of products in the cart, the total price, and a form with which to submit an order.
* An order confirmation page , thanking the user for their order, showing the total price and the order ID returned by the server.
